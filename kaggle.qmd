## Kaggle Notebook

You can write up to 20 GB to the current directory (`/kaggle/working/`)
that get preserved as output when creating a version with “Save & Run
All”. You can also write temporary files to `/kaggle/temp/` but they
won’t be saved outside of the current session.

## How to Win a Kaggle Competiton

1. a good validation set
2. solid baseline model
3. ensembling : The final piece of the puzzle is ensembling. The idea
  behind it is very straightforward. We want to combine predictions
  from multiple models in the hopes that their errors are not correlated.
  If model A makes different errors than model B, some of them will
  cancel out each other. Using a diverse set of models helps.
